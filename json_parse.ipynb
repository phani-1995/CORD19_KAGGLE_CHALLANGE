Because our study was conducted as part of a clinical trial, it benefitted from active follow-up, a well-characterized population, consistent methodology between countries, samples taken from a high proportion of children, and use of a sensitive and specific PCR assay for RSV detection. In addition, we studied a wide age range up to 10 years, unlike most other studies that typically focused on children aged ≤5 years. By stratifying the age groups, we could detect differences in incidence and prevalence across ages.\n",
      "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important agent to cause acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children; it also affects older adults and the immunocompromised [1] . RSV infection elicits symptoms ranging from sinusitis and otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1] . In temperate climates, outbreaks occur in winter months. Tropical countries also have RSV seasons but with greater variation than in temperate locations [2] .\n",

      "A review of the global burden of RSV estimates an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI associated with RSV infection in children aged <5 years [3] .

However, interpretation of the 6-11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6-11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] .

A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] .

A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6through 8-month age group [15] . In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0-to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3-through 5-and 9through 11-month age groups [15] . In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0-5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6-30 months [7] . A study in India reported a more uniform distribution of RSV-associated ALRI across age groups (3.3, 5.2, and 2.7 per 100 PY in children aged 0-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months, respectively) [16] .\n",

Tropical countries also have RSV seasons but with greater variation than in temperate locations [2] .\n",

      "A review of the global burden of RSV estimates an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI associated with RSV infection in children aged <5 years [3] . Just over 3 million episodes were estimated to result in hospitalization and between 66 000 and 199 000 in death [3] . Most deaths (99%) occur in the developing world [3] .

      "The high burden of RSV-associated morbidity and mortality means that development of safe and effective vaccines is a priority. Several candidates are in development [8] . However, more information on the epidemiology of RSV is needed to inform control strategies. Few studies have captured RSV burden using community-based active surveillance of healthy children and laboratory-confirmed RSV. In addition, the burden and seasonality of disease in southern hemisphere, tropical, and subtropical countries need to be better understood, as does the burden in specific age groups including older children.\n",

Swabs were transported in a single tube of M4RT transport medium, stored at −70°C, and maintained on dry ice during transport. Samples were ideally collected at the child's home, but a visit to a study center could be arranged if necessary. If the child was hospitalized, the sample was collected at the hospital if feasible. A 7-day symptom-free period was required between new ILI episodes. Analysis of samples for RSV (subtypes A and B) and other respiratory pathogens was performed using standard multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques [9, 10] .\n",

      "The primary outcome variable was PCR-confirmed RSV in nasal/throat swabs in children with ILI. The primary outcome included both single RSV infection and coinfections with other respiratory viruses. Single RSV infections and coinfections with other respiratory viruses were also recorded separately. Pneumonia was documented in children with ILI and was defined as an acute illness (1 or more of the following symptoms: fever [temperature, ≥38°C], new or worsening cough, dyspnea, consistent auscultation findings [rales or diminished breath sounds], pain in the chest or abdomen when breathing, or purulent or bloodstained sputum production) and radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia.

Prevalence was stratified according to country and age at the time of the ILI episode (6-11, 12-23, 24-35, 36-59, 60+ months), whether the child was medically attended (saw a doctor or other healthcare professional), and whether the child was hospitalized.

All observations with incomplete data for the outcome variable and ILI episodes for which no nasal/throat sample was taken were removed from the analysis.

      "To understand RSV epidemiology and implement effective control measures, it is essential to capture the RSV burden in communities. We therefore conducted 1 year of prospective active and passive community-based surveillance of healthy children in multiple tropical and southern hemisphere countries where prospective data are lacking. Because community-based surveillance is difficult and costly to carry out, most studies have been based on hospital-based surveillance. This captures only severe RSV infection that has resulted in hospitalization [3] and is limited in developing countries by its dependence on access to hospitals. Because our study was conducted as part of a clinical trial, it benefitted from active follow-up, a well-characterized population, consistent methodology between countries, samples taken from a high proportion of children, and use of a sensitive and specific PCR assay for RSV detection. In addition, we studied a wide age range up to 10 years, unlike most other studies that typically focused on children aged ≤5 years. By stratifying the age groups, we could detect differences in incidence and prevalence across ages.\n",

      "The study showed a prevalence of RSV type A or B in ILI ranging from 4.2% to 16.2% across countries, with an overall prevalence of 9.7%.

Overall, prevalence declined with age, ranging from 18.2% in the 6-through 11-month age group to 3.7% in the >60-month age group. The Philippines was the only country with the highest RSV prevalence in the youngest age group (37.1%); in other countries, the highest prevalence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24through 35-month age groups. The incidence of RSV in ILI across countries ranged from 0 to 81.1 per 100 PY (6-11 months), 0 to 31.1 per 100 PY (12-23 months), 10.8 to 24.7 Figure 2 . Prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes in which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected, by country and age (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction). Abbreviations: AU, Australia; BR, Brazil; CO, Colombia; CR, Costa Rica; MX, Mexico; PH, Philippines; SG, Singapore; TH, Thailand. were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6-11 months; in other countries, the highest incidence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24-through 35-month age groups. However, interpretation of the 6-11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6-11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] . The estimated incidence per 100 PY in these studies was 2.2 in Bangladesh, 2.7 in India, 4.8 in Indonesia, 8.4 in Kenya, 9.4 in Nigeria, and 12.8 in Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other active surveillance studies have evaluated RSV in different age groups. In children in Indonesia aged <59 months, the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was highest in children aged 6-23 months (19.8, 10.4, and 15.4 per 100 PY in the 6-through 8-, 9-through 11-, and 12-through 23-month age groups) [14] . A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6through 8-month age group [15] . In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0-to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3-through 5-and 9through 11-month age groups [15] . In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0-5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6-30 months [7] . A study in India reported a more uniform distribution of RSV-associated ALRI across age groups (3.3, 5.2, and 2.7 per 100 PY in children aged 0-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months, respectively) [16] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study illustrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness. As far as we know, it is the first active surveillance study of RSV to capture incidence data on medical attendance outside the hospital setting. Most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. One third of ILI episodes associated with RSV resulted in absence from school or day care; however, not all children attended school or day care. Eight of 88 ILI episodes that required hospitalization were associated with RSV, an overall incidence of 0.2 per 100 PY. This compares with RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization of 1 per 100 PY in Kenya [7] . However, surprisingly few pneumonia cases were observed in our study. A recent review of pneumonia worldwide estimated the number of new episodes of RSV-associated pneumonia in children aged 0-4 years to be 17 778 in Australia, 431 938 in Brazil, 140 879 in Colombia, 10 724 in Costa Rica, 320 132 in Mexico, 700 364 in the Philippines, 3126 in Singapore, and 186 889 in Thailand, although the incidence rate was not calculated [17] .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important study limitations was that only healthy children entered the efficacy trial (eg, no children with malnutrition), so that participants were healthier than those from a random community sample, thus, limiting generalizability. Despite this limitation, we demonstrated a high RSV burden, highlighting that it is not confined to children at high risk. Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged <2 years 6 months [18, 19] . In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses. Finally, we recruited no children aged <6 months and a limited number of children aged 6-11 months, so our findings are relevant only to older children. Our use of active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through the more usual hospitalbased surveillance methods. A substantial part of the RSV burden occurs in older infants and children. This has implications for future vaccination strategies, including the possibility of broadening the target age range.\n",
      "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important agent to cause acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children; it also affects older adults and the immunocompromised [1] . RSV infection elicits symptoms ranging from sinusitis and otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1] . In temperate climates, outbreaks occur in winter months.

This captures only severe RSV infection that has resulted in hospitalization [3] and is limited in developing countries by its dependence on access to hospitals. Because our study was conducted as part of a clinical trial, it benefitted from active follow-up, a well-characterized population, consistent methodology between countries, samples taken from a high proportion of children, and use of a sensitive and specific PCR assay for RSV detection.

Prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes in which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected, by country and age (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction). Abbreviations: AU, Australia; BR, Brazil; CO, Colombia; CR, Costa Rica; MX, Mexico; PH, Philippines; SG, Singapore; TH, Thailand. were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6-11 months; in other countries, the highest incidence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24-through 35-month age groups. However, interpretation of the 6-11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6-11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] . The estimated incidence per 100 PY in these studies was 2.2 in Bangladesh, 2.7 in India, 4.8 in Indonesia, 8.4 in Kenya, 9.4 in Nigeria, and 12.8 in Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other active surveillance studies have evaluated RSV in different age groups. In children in Indonesia aged <59 months, the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was highest in children aged 6-23 months (19.8, 10.4, and 15.4 per 100 PY in the 6-through 8-, 9-through 11-, and 12-through 23-month age groups) [14] . A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6through 8-month age group [15] . In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0-to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3-through 5-and 9through 11-month age groups [15] . In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0-5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6-30 months [7] . A study in India reported a more uniform distribution of RSV-associated ALRI across age groups (3.3, 5.2, and 2.7 per 100 PY in children aged 0-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months, respectively) [16] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study illustrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness. As far as we know, it is the first active surveillance study of RSV to capture incidence data on medical attendance outside the hospital setting. Most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. One third of ILI episodes associated with RSV resulted in absence from school or day care; however, not all children attended school or day care. Eight of 88 ILI episodes that required hospitalization were associated with RSV, an overall incidence of 0.2 per 100 PY. This compares with RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization of 1 per 100 PY in Kenya [7] . However, surprisingly few pneumonia cases were observed in our study. A recent review of pneumonia worldwide estimated the number of new episodes of RSV-associated pneumonia in children aged 0-4 years to be 17 778 in Australia, 431 938 in Brazil, 140 879 in Colombia, 10 724 in Costa Rica, 320 132 in Mexico, 700 364 in the Philippines, 3126 in Singapore, and 186 889 in Thailand, although the incidence rate was not calculated [17] .\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important study limitations was that only healthy children entered the efficacy trial (eg, no children with malnutrition), so that participants were healthier than those from a random community sample, thus, limiting generalizability. Despite this limitation, we demonstrated a high RSV burden, highlighting that it is not confined to children at high risk. Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged <2 years 6 months [18, 19] . In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses. Finally, we recruited no children aged <6 months and a limited number of children aged 6-11 months, so our findings are relevant only to older children. Our use of active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through the more usual hospitalbased surveillance methods. A substantial part of the RSV burden occurs in older infants and children. This has implications for future vaccination strategies, including the possibility of broadening the target age range.\n",

Few studies have captured RSV burden using community-based active surveillance of healthy children and laboratory-confirmed RSV. In addition, the burden and seasonality of disease in southern hemisphere, tropical, and subtropical countries need to be better understood, as does the burden in specific age groups including older children.\n",

Samples were ideally collected at the child's home, but a visit to a study center could be arranged if necessary. If the child was hospitalized, the sample was collected at the hospital if feasible. A 7-day symptom-free period was required between new ILI episodes. Analysis of samples for RSV (subtypes A and B) and other respiratory pathogens was performed using standard multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques [9, 10] .\n",

      "The primary outcome variable was PCR-confirmed RSV in nasal/throat swabs in children with ILI. The primary outcome included both single RSV infection and coinfections with other respiratory viruses. Single RSV infections and coinfections with other respiratory viruses were also recorded separately. Pneumonia was documented in children with ILI and was defined as an acute illness (1 or more of the following symptoms: fever [temperature, ≥38°C], new or worsening cough, dyspnea, consistent auscultation findings [rales or diminished breath sounds], pain in the chest or abdomen when breathing, or purulent or bloodstained sputum production) and radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia.

Prevalence was stratified according to country and age at the time of the ILI episode (6-11, 12-23, 24-35, 36-59, 60+ months), whether the child was medically attended (saw a doctor or other healthcare professional), and whether the child was hospitalized.

All observations with incomplete data for the outcome variable and ILI episodes for which no nasal/throat sample was taken were removed from the analysis.

The incidence of RSV in ILI across countries ranged from 0 to 81.1 per 100 PY (6-11 months), 0 to 31.1 per 100 PY (12-23 months), 10.8 to 24.7 Figure 2 . Prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes in which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected, by country and age (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction). Abbreviations: AU, Australia; BR, Brazil; CO, Colombia; CR, Costa Rica; MX, Mexico; PH, Philippines; SG, Singapore; TH, Thailand. were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6-11 months; in other countries, the highest incidence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24-through 35-month age groups. However, interpretation of the 6-11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6-11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] . The estimated incidence per 100 PY in these studies was 2.2 in Bangladesh, 2.7 in India, 4.8 in Indonesia, 8.4 in Kenya, 9.4 in Nigeria, and 12.8 in Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other active surveillance studies have evaluated RSV in different age groups. In children in Indonesia aged <59 months, the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was highest in children aged 6-23 months (19.8, 10.4, and 15.4 per 100 PY in the 6-through 8-, 9-through 11-, and 12-through 23-month age groups) [14] . A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6through 8-month age group [15] . In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0-to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3-through 5-and 9through 11-month age groups [15] . In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0-5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6-30 months [7] . A study in India reported a more uniform distribution of RSV-associated ALRI across age groups (3.3, 5.2, and 2.7 per 100 PY in children aged 0-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months, respectively) [16] .\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study illustrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness. As far as we know, it is the first active surveillance study of RSV to capture incidence data on medical attendance outside the hospital setting. Most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. One third of ILI episodes associated with RSV resulted in absence from school or day care; however, not all children attended school or day care. Eight of 88 ILI episodes that required hospitalization were associated with RSV, an overall incidence of 0.2 per 100 PY. This compares with RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization of 1 per 100 PY in Kenya [7] . However, surprisingly few pneumonia cases were observed in our study. A recent review of pneumonia worldwide estimated the number of new episodes of RSV-associated pneumonia in children aged 0-4 years to be 17 778 in Australia, 431 938 in Brazil, 140 879 in Colombia, 10 724 in Costa Rica, 320 132 in Mexico, 700 364 in the Philippines, 3126 in Singapore, and 186 889 in Thailand, although the incidence rate was not calculated [17] .\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important study limitations was that only healthy children entered the efficacy trial (eg, no children with malnutrition), so that participants were healthier than those from a random community sample, thus, limiting generalizability. Despite this limitation, we demonstrated a high RSV burden, highlighting that it is not confined to children at high risk. Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged <2 years 6 months [18, 19] . In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses. Finally, we recruited no children aged <6 months and a limited number of children aged 6-11 months, so our findings are relevant only to older children. Our use of active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through the more usual hospitalbased surveillance methods. A substantial part of the RSV burden occurs in older infants and children. This has implications for future vaccination strategies, including the possibility of broadening the target age range.\n",

Participants were then asked a series of specific questions related to their orthopaedic practice in order to understand the setting (urban vs. rural), volume of orthopaedic cases pre-and during COVID-19, and types of procedures currently being performed during COVID-19. Participants were then asked to delineate how COVID-19 has affected their orthopaedic practice in terms of number of orthopedic consultations per day, number of orthopaedic cases treated pre-and during COVID-19, as well as how the current orthopedic injuries presenting during COVID-19 compared with injury presentations prior to the outbreak.\n",

      "The questionnaire was completed by 63 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 28 different countries and 14 US states ( Fig. 1) . Of the surgeons who completed the survey, 19% practice in a rural area with an average of five orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system, while 81% of respondents practice in an urban setting with an average of 29 orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system. Furthermore, three out of the 28 represented countries are classified as low-income countries, and eight are classified as lower-middle-income countries (39% low-or middle-income countries) by the Fig. 2 a-c COVID-19 cases by country between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020 [11, 12] . Low-income country represented with ***. Lower middle-income country represented with **. Middle-income country represented with * 2019 WHO designation [13] (Table 1) . Given the global and regional diversity represented by our sample pool, each participant provides a unique perspective in terms of when and to what extent COVID-19 affected their orthopaedic practice. As seen in Fig. 2 -c, several participants began to experience COVID-19 in mid-February with cases continuing to climb through mid-April, while some participants have yet to experience a significant case load of COVID-19 patients. While countrywide data is widely accessible in terms of total COVID-19 cases, it is difficult to glean specific regional and hospital ramifications of COVID-19 on a global scale. Consequently, each participant in the study was asked to identify the percentage of total patients in their intensive care unit (ICU) filled by COVID-19 (+) patients. Most respondents noted that their ICU was less than 50% filled by COVID-19 positive patients, while only a few respondents noted 100% capacity of their ICU by COVID-19 (+) patients (Table 2 ). In addition to differences in the number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU of hospitals across the world, the level of laboratory testing at each hospital varied dramatically where 83% reported testing of symptomatic patients only, 56% reported testing of surgical patients, 40% reported testing healthcare workers, and 10% reported no testing at all ( Table 3) .\n",

Of the respondents, 68% reported their hospital typically performs more than 40 orthopaedic procedures per week prior to COVID-19. However, now, just 5% of participating hospitals are performing more than 40 procedures per week, with 80% performing less than 20 procedures per week (Fig. 3) . Additionally, the type of procedures being performed The majority of respondents noted less than 50% capacity of their ICU beds by COVID-19 (+) patients. One respondent left this question unanswered has been affected with just 17% of participating hospitals currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery (Table 4 ). In addition to the number and types of orthopaedic surgery being significantly altered during COVID-19, the actual type and mechanism of injury of patients itself are also different, as reported by 91% of participants (Table 5) . When asked, \"Have you observed differences in mechanism of injury trends in your practice since the onset of COVID-19?\", 65% of participants answered yes, while 56% identified specific patterns of change in their patient pool.

      "Orthopaedic departments themselves are also undergoing massive change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the respondents, 30% noted that their orthopaedic department has had to deploy orthopaedic residents, fellows, or attendings to work on non-orthopedic floors in order to help mitigate the overwhelming patient load. Furthermore, changes have been made to the department staffing models including rotating surgical teams with implemented isolation to minimize cross-exposure (56%), reduction of personnel in operating rooms and on site to the minimum necessary to provide coverage, and lastly, the introduction of virtual meetings and case presentations via various video platforms (Table 6) .\n",

The virus began to disseminate throughout the world, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a global pandemic, which classifies the outbreak as an international emergency [1, 2] .\n",

      "COVID-19 has severely altered the day-to-day life and operations for people, economies, and healthcare systems alike. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has created an expeditious implementation of new practices and principles that healthcare leaders have adopted in order to most effectively remain ahead of the curve. Unlike ever before, COVID-19 has highlighted geographical differences from provider to provider as to which methodologies were developed, how they were employed, and with what efficacy. In large part, these methodologies have been predicated upon characteristics specific to the host environment, such as viral seroprevalence, population density, socioeconomic factors, local governance, and resource limitations. For example, Milan, Italy, representative of a high population density and an overwhelming case load of COVID-19 positive patients, faces challenges distinct from those of Makwasa, Malawi, with lower population density and relatively low incidence of COVID-19.\n",

      "Because the peak of COVID-19 cases have and will surge at different time points in different geographies, much can be learned about how various global providers have responded to the crisis [2] [3] [4] [5] . Currently, there is a growing emphasis on the relevance of observational research in identifying factors, challenges, and responses to this pandemic among orthopaedic practices throughout the world [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Our team believes that there is value in learning from the experiences of orthopaedic professionals in many global settings, such that localized planning may transition from rapid-fire response to informed expectations and processes. Not only will these lessons allow us to better understand and overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic, but they will help the global orthopaedic community prepare for future outbreaks that may reach a scale such as the one we are living through today.\n",

      "Survey participation was carried out in the month of April 2020 between April 16, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Participation in this cross-sectional questionnaire was voluntary, and orthopaedic trauma surgeons were included in the study based on voluntary interest. \n",

Several time points were included throughout this five month span in order to understand the evolution of the case load and death rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 20-item questionnaire was sent out to 150 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 42 countries across the globe who were identified based on professional relationships and/or prior involvement in international meetings either led or participated by the senior author. Each participant was first asked to identify personal demographics including city, country, and hospital of their orthopaedic practice. Participants were then asked a series of specific questions related to their orthopaedic practice in order to understand the setting (urban vs. rural), volume of orthopaedic cases pre-and during COVID-19, and types of procedures currently being performed during COVID-19. Participants were then asked to delineate how COVID-19 has affected their orthopaedic practice in terms of number of orthopedic consultations per day, number of orthopaedic cases treated pre-and during COVID-19, as well as how the current orthopedic injuries presenting during COVID-19 compared with injury presentations prior to the outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, participants were asked to describe their adoption of telemedicine practices. Each participant differentiated between the adoption of telephone-only visits, telephone and video visits, or no adoption of telemedicine visits at all. Furthermore, participants were asked to describe how they believed the rapid changes in medicine that are occurring due to the COVID-19 pandemic would permanently affect their future practices after the global pandemic ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each participant was then asked several questions with regard to the current state of equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) at their hospital. If their facility was experiencing shortages, participants were asked to identify what was being done to address it. Additionally, participants were asked to identify whether all providers were given the same access to PPE or if certain departments (i.e., anesthesia or emergency medicine) had more access to PPE. Participants were then asked questions to categorize the level of COVID-19 testing currently taking place at their hospital and to describe policy changes at the hospital including restructuring to the staffing model and/or if orthopaedic residents/fellows/attendings at their hospital were tasked with working on nonorthopaedic hospital floors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, participants were asked open-ended, free-text questions to identify the most significant challenges to their orthopaedic practice in dealing with COVID-19. This included what they wish they had known prior to the outbreak that would have helped them now; how they are addressing the challenges being presented by COVID-19; and any personal experience, thoughts, or opinions as a medical professional working in the COVID-19 pandemic in their respective country.\n",

      "The questionnaire was completed by 63 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 28 different countries and 14 US states ( Fig. 1) . Of the surgeons who completed the survey, 19% practice in a rural area with an average of five orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system, while 81% of respondents practice in an urban setting with an average of 29 orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system. Furthermore, three out of the 28 represented countries are classified as low-income countries, and eight are classified as lower-middle-income countries (39% low-or middle-income countries) by the Fig. 2 a-c COVID-19 cases by country between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020 [11, 12] . Low-income country represented with ***. Lower middle-income country represented with **. Middle-income country represented with * 2019 WHO designation [13] (Table 1) . Given the global and regional diversity represented by our sample pool, each participant provides a unique perspective in terms of when and to what extent COVID-19 affected their orthopaedic practice. As seen in Fig. 2 -c, several participants began to experience COVID-19 in mid-February with cases continuing to climb through mid-April, while some participants have yet to experience a significant case load of COVID-19 patients. While countrywide data is widely accessible in terms of total COVID-19 cases, it is difficult to glean specific regional and hospital ramifications of COVID-19 on a global scale. Consequently, each participant in the study was asked to identify the percentage of total patients in their intensive care unit (ICU) filled by COVID-19 (+) patients. Most respondents noted that their ICU was less than 50% filled by COVID-19 positive patients, while only a few respondents noted 100% capacity of their ICU by COVID-19 (+) patients (Table 2 ). In addition to differences in the number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU of hospitals across the world, the level of laboratory testing at each hospital varied dramatically where 83% reported testing of symptomatic patients only, 56% reported testing of surgical patients, 40% reported testing healthcare workers, and 10% reported no testing at all ( Table 3) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of COVID-19 are not only causing significant changes in the ICUs of each of the participating hospitals but greatly impacting orthopaedic trauma departments in terms of the number and type of orthopaedic procedures being performed. Of the respondents, 68% reported their hospital typically performs more than 40 orthopaedic procedures per week prior to COVID-19. However, now, just 5% of participating hospitals are performing more than 40 procedures per week, with 80% performing less than 20 procedures per week (Fig. 3) . Additionally, the type of procedures being performed The majority of respondents noted less than 50% capacity of their ICU beds by COVID-19 (+) patients. One respondent left this question unanswered has been affected with just 17% of participating hospitals currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery (Table 4 ). In addition to the number and types of orthopaedic surgery being significantly altered during COVID-19, the actual type and mechanism of injury of patients itself are also different, as reported by 91% of participants (Table 5) . When asked, \"Have you observed differences in mechanism of injury trends in your practice since the onset of COVID-19?\", 65% of participants answered yes, while 56% identified specific patterns of change in their patient pool. Their responses shed light on how the current crisis affects orthopaedic epidemiological trends across different geographical settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orthopaedic departments themselves are also undergoing massive change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the respondents, 30% noted that their orthopaedic department has had to deploy orthopaedic residents, fellows, or attendings to work on non-orthopedic floors in order to help mitigate the overwhelming patient load. Furthermore, changes have been made to the department staffing models including rotating surgical teams with implemented isolation to minimize cross-exposure (56%), reduction of personnel in operating rooms and on site to the minimum necessary to provide coverage, and lastly, the introduction of virtual meetings and case presentations via various video platforms (Table 6) .\n",
      "\n",
      "While orthopaedic departments are undergoing rapid change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the departments and hospitals alike are experiencing significant shortages in equipment and/or personal protective equipment (PPE). Of the respondents, 85% noted some shortage of PPE, with the most common being N-95 masks (57%), followed by surgical masks (44%), face shields (41%), and hand sanitizer (29%). Many respondents' departments and hospitals were Another remarkable change in orthopaedic departments across the world has been the adoption of telemedicine into their practice. Of the participating orthopaedic departments, 73% reported the adoption of telemedicine, with the majority implementing telephone and video visits (48%) and some only telephone visits (25%) (Fig. 7) . Of the respondents representing high-income countries, 78% noted the adoption of telemedicine, while 55% of LMICs adopted telemedicine practices. Furthermore, 54% of total respondents noted that telemedicine would most likely become a permanent change to their practice post COVID-19, with an even greater percentage (74%) of those who have already implemented telemedicine practices in response to COVID-19 recognizing it would likely be a permanent change. Of those that identified telemedicine as a more permanent change to their practice, 80% represented HICs, and 20% represented LMICs.\n",

      "This paper includes the largest sample size of orthopaedic trauma surgeons describing the effects of COVID-19 on their practice to date, which allows us to highlight the environment Many departments have implemented rotating surgical teams to minimize cross-exposure, and some orthopedic departments have had deployed surgeons to work on non-orthopedic floors The majority of respondents noted a decrease in total orthopedic volume, many of which noting a specific change in mechanism of injury as well (Table 1) . While there are still many challenges to overcome, several lessons can be learned from the experiences presented by our study participants.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the main issues highlighted by emerging literature on COVID-19 is the shortage of equipment, specifically ventilators, as well as PPE, and what structural changes and policies have been implemented in order to help mitigate this. Many of our respondents echoed this concern, responding to the question, \"What do you wish you would have known prior to this outbreak that would have helped alleviate challenges you are experiencing now?\", with remarks related to PPE. Respondents noted their wish to know what the limit of PPE was at their facility prior to the pandemic, for the ability to stockpile PPE for their staff prior to the outbreak, and for better storage capacities of PPE in general as well as earlier policies to address the shortages. The results of this survey highlight that the shortages are not unique to one region or country but rather a global issue. Several strategies have worked well for our respondents, including donation of PPE by local community members and businesses as well as reduction in allotted PPE per provider per day. Additionally, prioritizing the types of providers at highest risk of exposure to the virus has allowed hospitals to maintain supplies at a level necessary to continue to function Fig. 5 Hospital mechanisms to address shortages in PPE. Many hospitals are relying on a reduction in PPE allotment, increased supply, and donations by community/local businesses in order to maintain adequate PPE levels Fig. 6 Method of allotment of PPE by specific hospitals. Many hospitals are allotting PPE to intensivists/anesthesiologists first, while some are providing equal PPE to all providers and to treat patients during this pandemic. However, future planning must account for the shortages we are facing now through coordinated local and country responses, as well as hospital specific responses to implement the policies noted above earlier, and to a greater extent.\n",

There have been many hypotheses about how the current healthcare conditions may affect the operations of clinical care moving forward, one of the main variables in this discussion being the use of telemedicine [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the USA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) broadened telehealth indications to allow doctors to provide more services, and private health insurers were soon to follow [18] . As a result, millions of patients and providers in the USA are using telemedicine for the first time. Berkson et al. recently published the first protocol and methods to conduct a virtual orthopaedic examination via telemedicine [14] . However, what is unclear is how these updated guidelines affect orthopaedic practices going forward and whether telemedicine has been embraced in the global orthopedic context. This sample supports two conclusions in regard to telemedicine adoption: (1) the majority of orthopaedic trauma surgeons worldwide have implemented telehealth capabilities and (2) the majority of orthopaedic trauma surgeons worldwide believe that the use of telemedicine will be a permanent change in their practice moving forward.\n",

      "The questionnaire was completed by 63 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 28 different countries and 14 US states ( Fig. 1) . Of the surgeons who completed the survey, 19% practice in a rural area with an average of five orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system, while 81% of respondents practice in an urban setting with an average of 29 orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system. Furthermore, three out of the 28 represented countries are classified as low-income countries, and eight are classified as lower-middle-income countries (39% low-or middle-income countries) by the Fig. 2 a-c COVID-19 cases by country between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020 [11, 12] . Low-income country represented with ***. Lower middle-income country represented with **. Middle-income country represented with * 2019 WHO designation [13] (Table 1) . Given the global and regional diversity represented by our sample pool, each participant provides a unique perspective in terms of when and to what extent COVID-19 affected their orthopaedic practice. As seen in Fig. 2 -c, several participants began to experience COVID-19 in mid-February with cases continuing to climb through mid-April, while some participants have yet to experience a significant case load of COVID-19 patients. While countrywide data is widely accessible in terms of total COVID-19 cases, it is difficult to glean specific regional and hospital ramifications of COVID-19 on a global scale. Consequently, each participant in the study was asked to identify the percentage of total patients in their intensive care unit (ICU) filled by COVID-19 (+) patients. Most respondents noted that their ICU was less than 50% filled by COVID-19 positive patients, while only a few respondents noted 100% capacity of their ICU by COVID-19 (+) patients (Table 2 ). In addition to differences in the number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU of hospitals across the world, the level of laboratory testing at each hospital varied dramatically where 83% reported testing of symptomatic patients only, 56% reported testing of surgical patients, 40% reported testing healthcare workers, and 10% reported no testing at all ( Table 3) .\n",

      "The effects of COVID-19 are not only causing significant changes in the ICUs of each of the participating hospitals but greatly impacting orthopaedic trauma departments in terms of the number and type of orthopaedic procedures being performed. Of the respondents, 68% reported their hospital typically performs more than 40 orthopaedic procedures per week prior to COVID-19. However, now, just 5% of participating hospitals are performing more than 40 procedures per week, with 80% performing less than 20 procedures per week (Fig. 3) . Additionally, the type of procedures being performed The majority of respondents noted less than 50% capacity of their ICU beds by COVID-19 (+) patients. One respondent left this question unanswered has been affected with just 17% of participating hospitals currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery (Table 4 ). In addition to the number and types of orthopaedic surgery being significantly altered during COVID-19, the actual type and mechanism of injury of patients itself are also different, as reported by 91% of participants (Table 5) . When asked, \"Have you observed differences in mechanism of injury trends in your practice since the onset of COVID-19?\", 65% of participants answered yes, while 56% identified specific patterns of change in their patient pool. Their responses shed light on how the current crisis affects orthopaedic epidemiological trends across different geographical settings.\n",

      "Orthopaedic departments themselves are also undergoing massive change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the respondents, 30% noted that their orthopaedic department has had to deploy orthopaedic residents, fellows, or attendings to work on non-orthopedic floors in order to help mitigate the overwhelming patient load. Furthermore, changes have been made to the department staffing models including rotating surgical teams with implemented isolation to minimize cross-exposure (56%), reduction of personnel in operating rooms and on site to the minimum necessary to provide coverage, and lastly, the introduction of virtual meetings and case presentations via various video platforms (Table 6) .\n",

      "While orthopaedic departments are undergoing rapid change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the departments and hospitals alike are experiencing significant shortages in equipment and/or personal protective equipment (PPE).

Many respondents' departments and hospitals were Another remarkable change in orthopaedic departments across the world has been the adoption of telemedicine into their practice. Of the participating orthopaedic departments, 73% reported the adoption of telemedicine, with the majority implementing telephone and video visits (48%) and some only telephone visits (25%) (Fig. 7) . Of the respondents representing high-income countries, 78% noted the adoption of telemedicine, while 55% of LMICs adopted telemedicine practices. Furthermore, 54% of total respondents noted that telemedicine would most likely become a permanent change to their practice post COVID-19, with an even greater percentage (74%) of those who have already implemented telemedicine practices in response to COVID-19 recognizing it would likely be a permanent change. Of those that identified telemedicine as a more permanent change to their practice, 80% represented HICs, and 20% represented LMICs.\n",

      "One of the main issues highlighted by emerging literature on COVID-19 is the shortage of equipment, specifically ventilators, as well as PPE, and what structural changes and policies have been implemented in order to help mitigate this. Many of our respondents echoed this concern, responding to the question, \"What do you wish you would have known prior to this outbreak that would have helped alleviate challenges you are experiencing now?\", with remarks related to PPE. Respondents noted their wish to know what the limit of PPE was at their facility prior to the pandemic, for the ability to stockpile PPE for their staff prior to the outbreak, and for better storage capacities of PPE in general as well as earlier policies to address the shortages. The results of this survey highlight that the shortages are not unique to one region or country but rather a global issue. Several strategies have worked well for our respondents, including donation of PPE by local community members and businesses as well as reduction in allotted PPE per provider per day. Additionally, prioritizing the types of providers at highest risk of exposure to the virus has allowed hospitals to maintain supplies at a level necessary to continue to function Fig. 5 Hospital mechanisms to address shortages in PPE. Many hospitals are relying on a reduction in PPE allotment, increased supply, and donations by community/local businesses in order to maintain adequate PPE levels Fig. 6 Method of allotment of PPE by specific hospitals. Many hospitals are allotting PPE to intensivists/anesthesiologists first, while some are providing equal PPE to all providers and to treat patients during this pandemic. However, future planning must account for the shortages we are facing now through coordinated local and country responses, as well as hospital specific responses to implement the policies noted above earlier, and to a greater extent.\n",

      "Lastly, participants were asked open-ended, free-text questions to identify the most significant challenges to their orthopaedic practice in dealing with COVID-19. This included what they wish they had known prior to the outbreak that would have helped them now; how they are addressing the challenges being presented by COVID-19; and any personal experience, thoughts, or opinions as a medical professional working in the COVID-19 pandemic in their respective country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical analysis was made using JMP Pro 15 by SAS. The data coding was done by a single person and provided by the investigators. Descriptive statistics were reported for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The questionnaire was completed by 63 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 28 different countries and 14 US states ( Fig. 1) . Of the surgeons who completed the survey, 19% practice in a rural area with an average of five orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system, while 81% of respondents practice in an urban setting with an average of 29 orthopaedic surgeons in their hospital system. Furthermore, three out of the 28 represented countries are classified as low-income countries, and eight are classified as lower-middle-income countries (39% low-or middle-income countries) by the Fig. 2 a-c COVID-19 cases by country between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020 [11, 12] . Low-income country represented with ***. Lower middle-income country represented with **. Middle-income country represented with * 2019 WHO designation [13] (Table 1) . Given the global and regional diversity represented by our sample pool, each participant provides a unique perspective in terms of when and to what extent COVID-19 affected their orthopaedic practice. As seen in Fig. 2 -c, several participants began to experience COVID-19 in mid-February with cases continuing to climb through mid-April, while some participants have yet to experience a significant case load of COVID-19 patients. While countrywide data is widely accessible in terms of total COVID-19 cases, it is difficult to glean specific regional and hospital ramifications of COVID-19 on a global scale. Consequently, each participant in the study was asked to identify the percentage of total patients in their intensive care unit (ICU) filled by COVID-19 (+) patients. Most respondents noted that their ICU was less than 50% filled by COVID-19 positive patients, while only a few respondents noted 100% capacity of their ICU by COVID-19 (+) patients (Table 2 ). In addition to differences in the number of COVID-19 patients in the ICU of hospitals across the world, the level of laboratory testing at each hospital varied dramatically where 83% reported testing of symptomatic patients only, 56% reported testing of surgical patients, 40% reported testing healthcare workers, and 10% reported no testing at all ( Table 3) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of COVID-19 are not only causing significant changes in the ICUs of each of the participating hospitals but greatly impacting orthopaedic trauma departments in terms of the number and type of orthopaedic procedures being performed. Of the respondents, 68% reported their hospital typically performs more than 40 orthopaedic procedures per week prior to COVID-19. However, now, just 5% of participating hospitals are performing more than 40 procedures per week, with 80% performing less than 20 procedures per week (Fig. 3) . Additionally, the type of procedures being performed The majority of respondents noted less than 50% capacity of their ICU beds by COVID-19 (+) patients. One respondent left this question unanswered has been affected with just 17% of participating hospitals currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery (Table 4 ). In addition to the number and types of orthopaedic surgery being significantly altered during COVID-19, the actual type and mechanism of injury of patients itself are also different, as reported by 91% of participants (Table 5) . When asked, \"Have you observed differences in mechanism of injury trends in your practice since the onset of COVID-19?\", 65% of participants answered yes, while 56% identified specific patterns of change in their patient pool. Their responses shed light on how the current crisis affects orthopaedic epidemiological trends across different geographical settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orthopaedic departments themselves are also undergoing massive change during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the respondents, 30% noted that their orthopaedic department has had to deploy orthopaedic residents, fellows, or attendings to work on non-orthopedic floors in order to help mitigate the overwhelming patient load. Furthermore, changes have been made to the department staffing models including rotating surgical teams with implemented isolation to minimize cross-exposure (56%), reduction of personnel in operating rooms and on site to the minimum necessary to provide coverage, and lastly, the introduction of virtual meetings and case presentations via various video platforms (Table 6) .\n",
      "\n",
      "While orthopaedic departments are undergoing rapid change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the departments and hospitals alike are experiencing significant shortages in equipment and/or personal protective equipment (PPE). Of the respondents, 85% noted some shortage of PPE, with the most common being N-95 masks (57%), followed by surgical masks (44%), face shields (41%), and hand sanitizer (29%). Many respondents' departments and hospitals were Another remarkable change in orthopaedic departments across the world has been the adoption of telemedicine into their practice. Of the participating orthopaedic departments, 73% reported the adoption of telemedicine, with the majority implementing telephone and video visits (48%) and some only telephone visits (25%) (Fig. 7) . Of the respondents representing high-income countries, 78% noted the adoption of telemedicine, while 55% of LMICs adopted telemedicine practices. Furthermore, 54% of total respondents noted that telemedicine would most likely become a permanent change to their practice post COVID-19, with an even greater percentage (74%) of those who have already implemented telemedicine practices in response to COVID-19 recognizing it would likely be a permanent change. Of those that identified telemedicine as a more permanent change to their practice, 80% represented HICs, and 20% represented LMICs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper includes the largest sample size of orthopaedic trauma surgeons describing the effects of COVID-19 on their practice to date, which allows us to highlight the environment Many departments have implemented rotating surgical teams to minimize cross-exposure, and some orthopedic departments have had deployed surgeons to work on non-orthopedic floors The majority of respondents noted a decrease in total orthopedic volume, many of which noting a specific change in mechanism of injury as well (Table 1) . While there are still many challenges to overcome, several lessons can be learned from the experiences presented by our study participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main issues highlighted by emerging literature on COVID-19 is the shortage of equipment, specifically ventilators, as well as PPE, and what structural changes and policies have been implemented in order to help mitigate this. Many of our respondents echoed this concern, responding to the question, \"What do you wish you would have known prior to this outbreak that would have helped alleviate challenges you are experiencing now?\", with remarks related to PPE. Respondents noted their wish to know what the limit of PPE was at their facility prior to the pandemic, for the ability to stockpile PPE for their staff prior to the outbreak, and for better storage capacities of PPE in general as well as earlier policies to address the shortages. The results of this survey highlight that the shortages are not unique to one region or country but rather a global issue. Several strategies have worked well for our respondents, including donation of PPE by local community members and businesses as well as reduction in allotted PPE per provider per day. Additionally, prioritizing the types of providers at highest risk of exposure to the virus has allowed hospitals to maintain supplies at a level necessary to continue to function Fig. 5 Hospital mechanisms to address shortages in PPE. Many hospitals are relying on a reduction in PPE allotment, increased supply, and donations by community/local businesses in order to maintain adequate PPE levels Fig. 6 Method of allotment of PPE by specific hospitals. Many hospitals are allotting PPE to intensivists/anesthesiologists first, while some are providing equal PPE to all providers and to treat patients during this pandemic. However, future planning must account for the shortages we are facing now through coordinated local and country responses, as well as hospital specific responses to implement the policies noted above earlier, and to a greater extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another rapidly emerging topic in the precipitous spread of COVID-19 across the world has been the swift adoption of telemedicine. There have been many hypotheses about how the current healthcare conditions may affect the operations of clinical care moving forward, one of the main variables in this discussion being the use of telemedicine [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the USA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) broadened telehealth indications to allow doctors to provide more services, and private health insurers were soon to follow [18] . As a result, millions of patients and providers in the USA are using telemedicine for the first time. Berkson et al. recently published the first protocol and methods to conduct a virtual orthopaedic examination via telemedicine [14] . However, what is unclear is how these updated guidelines affect orthopaedic practices going forward and whether telemedicine has been embraced in the global orthopedic context. This sample supports two conclusions in regard to telemedicine adoption: (1) the majority of orthopaedic trauma surgeons worldwide have implemented telehealth capabilities and (2) the majority of orthopaedic trauma surgeons worldwide believe that the use of telemedicine will be a permanent change in their practice moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our study has several limitations. First, our sampling technique was specific to academic surgeons who had attended professional meetings or formed professional relationships with our senior author. Our goal was to highlight the environment of orthopedic trauma practices around the world in combatting COVID-19 in an efficient and expedient manner, which is why this method was chosen. Second is a lack of knowledge as to specifics of what type of COVID-19 testing participants were referring to as well as what specific types of PPE referenced by respondents. Lastly, there is subjectivity in relying on surgeon's knowledge for percentage of ICU patients occupied by COVID-19 (+) patients and COVID testing data. However, these numbers were validated with official sources whenever the data was available.\n",
      "\n",
      "To our knowledge, this is the largest data set characterizing the different COVID-19 situations and responses of orthopedic trauma practices around the world. There is much to be learned from each of these participants' responses. Furthermore, the distribution and completion of this questionnaire highlight the power of worldwide communication and coordination. In a short period of time, 63 orthopaedic trauma Fig. 7 Number of countries implementing telemedicine. Most countries are implementing telemedicine visits in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Six out of 11 low-or middle-income countries (55%) have implemented telemedicine, while 14 out of 18 high-income countries (78%) have implemented telemedicine surgeons from 28 different countries were able to describe their unique challenges as it relates to their orthopaedic practice and hospital combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important that we recognize the power of global communication and coordinated responses, learning from each other's successes and failures alike, in order to prevent a global pandemic like we are living through now from occurring again in the future.\n",

Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony.

Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier. This was announced on 20th of January by a major and well-known doctor, Dr. Zhong Nan Shan, in a CCTV online interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a critical period, when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed. Figure 1a shows the number of people affected, recovered and dead in China and Hubei province, and Figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province. At an early part of this phase, a few critical and wise decisions were made:\n",

      "22nd January: Hubei province announced a Level II public emergency; 23rd of January: Wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted. The decision to construct Huoshenshan Hospital (new hospital) for Corona virus cases was announced on this day (23rd January), followed the decision to construct Leishenshan Hospital (another new hospital) decision on 25th January.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",

      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics).

Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

The next phase was a phase of panic, criticism, agony and sad news. The following events took place that explain this phase:\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns.

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease).

Overseas news, especially the spread of Coronavirus in a cruise ship in Japan (Diamond Princess) was broadcast in China through different media;\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine.

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns.

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease).

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine.

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time.

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

      "\n",
      "The following phase was a time of positive prevention and curative planning. Several new initiatives were taken through media to address public criticism as well as to lessen public agony:\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Dead bodies post-mortem had started to identify the key medical factors and impacts on the body. On the 18th of February, a unique approach of using a QR code was adopted in Wuhan and then spread to other parts of Hubei province using mobility and safety of the person (in terms of effect of Corona virus). This QR code was used for public transport, entering public areas. Using big data in mobile phones, three color coding were used ( Figure 3 ): green (safe), yellow (need to be cautious), and red (cannot enter). Printed QR codes were used for the people who did not have mobile phones (like elderly people or children).

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",

      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020.

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",

      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

On the 18th of February, a unique approach of using a QR code was adopted in Wuhan and then spread to other parts of Hubei province using mobility and safety of the person (in terms of effect of Corona virus). This QR code was used for public transport, entering public areas. Using big data in mobile phones, three color coding were used ( Figure 3 ): green (safe), yellow (need to be cautious), and red (cannot enter). Printed QR codes were used for the people who did not have mobile phones (like elderly people or children). On 19 th of February, the \"no one will be spared\" policy was ended. 20th February: A newlywed young doctor passed away, which also created negative sentiment in social media.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020.

      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious.

The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "As mentioned above, an analysis was done by CSM Media Research with 1500 residents all over China on the mobile they use to access different sites. Figure 4 shows different media usage on four different aspects: increased usage after Coronavirus spread, same use as before, less use than before and do not use it for 6 months. Analysis shows that WeChat and TV played a strong role in acquiring information after Coronavirus spread. The amount of applications has also increased compared to other media usage, since it provides real-time information. The survey also pointed out that 44% people sought to proactively secure information, followed the news and put in their favorites. A total of 33% viewed the information proactively, but did not put it into their favorite news items. A total of 19% people saw the information if it was in the news or media; 2% of people did not bother to take any additional actions for information gathering, while another 2% did not want to hear the negative news on Coronavirus. Figure 5 shows the types of information accessed by different users through online platforms. It shows that the maximum access was to get information on medicines, followed by a set of other information like food/drink, online education, in-house sports, business information and entertainment and leisure goods. This shows the lifestyle requirements when people were isolated in their home for a long period of time.

      "As seen in Figure 5 , medicine, food supply and online education were the top searched items. Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage. They are as follows: Hema Fresh (up by 50% compared to before the virus spread), Miss Fresh (up by 321% compared to January 2019), Dingdong Maicai (up by 300% from December 2019), and Jing dong Daojia (up by 470% compared to January 2019). All the companies are struggling with a lack of human resources and shared their employees to help each other, which delayed delivery in several cases.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "To develop this narrative, as mentioned above, a large number of sources were consulted, reviewed and some milestones events are presented here. Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier.

Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected.

However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",

      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",

      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020.

      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage.

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020.

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative.

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage. They are as follows: Hema Fresh (up by 50% compared to before the virus spread), Miss Fresh (up by 321% compared to January 2019), Dingdong Maicai (up by 300% from December 2019), and Jing dong Daojia (up by 470% compared to January 2019).

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine.

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

New confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province; (Source: these graphs were prepared by the authors using original data from: Sina News [5] ). b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020).

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020.

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier.

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020).

      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] :\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section.

The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

      "This phase was characterized by a crackdown by local government and detailed investigation. Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city was closed on 1st of January. The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier. This was announced on 20th of January by a major and well-known doctor, Dr. Zhong Nan Shan, in a CCTV online interview.\n",

      "This was a critical period, when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed. Figure 1a shows the number of people affected, recovered and dead in China and Hubei province, and Figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province. At an early part of this phase, a few critical and wise decisions were made:\n",

      "22nd January: Hubei province announced a Level II public emergency; 23rd of January: Wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted. The decision to construct Huoshenshan Hospital (new hospital) for Corona virus cases was announced on this day (23rd January), followed the decision to construct Leishenshan Hospital (another new hospital) decision on 25th January. Ten hospitals in Wuhan city appealed for a supply of medical and other emergency goods from all over the country;\n",

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020).

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease).

      "To develop this narrative, as mentioned above, a large number of sources were consulted, reviewed and some milestones events are presented here. Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

      "Positive prevention and curative control phase: Until 29 February 2020. Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019.\n",

      "This phase was characterized by a crackdown by local government and detailed investigation. Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city was closed on 1st of January. The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier. This was announced on 20th of January by a major and well-known doctor, Dr. Zhong Nan Shan, in a CCTV online interview.\n",

      "This was a critical period, when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed. Figure 1a shows the number of people affected, recovered and dead in China and Hubei province, and Figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province. At an early part of this phase, a few critical and wise decisions were made:\n",

      "22nd January: Hubei province announced a Level II public emergency; 23rd of January: Wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted. The decision to construct Huoshenshan Hospital (new hospital) for Corona virus cases was announced on this day (23rd January), followed the decision to construct Leishenshan Hospital (another new hospital) decision on 25th January. Ten hospitals in Wuhan city appealed for a supply of medical and other emergency goods from all over the country;\n",

      "As seen in Figure 5 , medicine, food supply and online education were the top searched items. Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage.

      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease).

      "To develop this narrative, as mentioned above, a large number of sources were consulted, reviewed and some milestones events are presented here. Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

      "Positive prevention and curative control phase: Until 29 February 2020. Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019.\n",

      "This phase was characterized by a crackdown by local government and detailed investigation. Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city was closed on 1st of January. The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier. This was announced on 20th of January by a major and well-known doctor, Dr. Zhong Nan Shan, in a CCTV online interview.\n",

      "This was a critical period, when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed. Figure 1a shows the number of people affected, recovered and dead in China and Hubei province, and Figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province. At an early part of this phase, a few critical and wise decisions were made:\n",

      "22nd January: Hubei province announced a Level II public emergency; 23rd of January: Wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted. The decision to construct Huoshenshan Hospital (new hospital) for Corona virus cases was announced on this day (23rd January), followed the decision to construct Leishenshan Hospital (another new hospital) decision on 25th January. Ten hospitals in Wuhan city appealed for a supply of medical and other emergency goods from all over the country;\n",

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020).

      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "To develop this narrative, as mentioned above, a large number of sources were consulted, reviewed and some milestones events are presented here. Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

      "Positive prevention and curative control phase: Until 29 February 2020. Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month.

      "This phase was characterized by a crackdown by local government and detailed investigation. Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city was closed on 1st of January. The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier. This was announced on 20th of January by a major and well-known doctor, Dr. Zhong Nan Shan, in a CCTV online interview.\n",

      "This was a critical period, when the disease spread was intensified and a relatively large number of casualties was observed. Figure 1a shows the number of people affected, recovered and dead in China and Hubei province, and Figure 1b shows the new confirmed and recovered cases in China and Hubei province. At an early part of this phase, a few critical and wise decisions were made:\n",
      "\n",
      "22nd January: Hubei province announced a Level II public emergency; 23rd of January: Wuhan city was closed and all the entries and exits to the city were restricted. The decision to construct Huoshenshan Hospital (new hospital) for Corona virus cases was announced on this day (23rd January), followed the decision to construct Leishenshan Hospital (another new hospital) decision on 25th January. Ten hospitals in Wuhan city appealed for a supply of medical and other emergency goods from all over the country;\n",

      "25th January: The Supreme court provided instruction on \"Fake news\" and the negative consequences of this. Tencent, which is the parent company of WeChat, established a website called \"Rumors exposed website,\" as a platform to reduce rumors; 26th of January: The first emergency supply arrived from Sichuan to Wuhan, along with medical and healthcare staff;\n",

A new policy of \"no one will be spared\" was started (this enabled the government to enter people's house and check for virus symptoms). Dou Ban, a major media group, was shut down. Overseas news, especially the spread of Coronavirus in a cruise ship in Japan (Diamond Princess) was broadcast in China through different media;\n",

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage.

      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier.

Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage.

      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] :\n",
      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From our own analysis, it was observed that the success of China's efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance, strict regulation and spontaneous community/citizen participation. Although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage, once the disease was confirmed as a new one, collective responses at the community, ward, city, province and national levels were significant. To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",
      "\n",
      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster.

A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020).

      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] :\n",
      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our own analysis, it was observed that the success of China's efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance, strict regulation and spontaneous community/citizen participation. Although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage, once the disease was confirmed as a new one, collective responses at the community, ward, city, province and national levels were significant. To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These lessons are also reflected in the WHO research roadmap [29] , where eight specific research issues have been identified with a balance of medical diagnosis and community use. It also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response, where the WHO will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences. As per [30] , governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30] .\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",
      "\n",
      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online. (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative.

The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the Figure 2 shows the timeline of key events in five phases. Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

Needless to say, with a vast country like China, with the level of infection of Corona Virus, there are many small yet important events, which may be missed out here. However, the author tried to highlight the key developments in China based on the five following phases:\n",

The city government and its health commission investigated the cases in December and called Dr. Li and made him apologize for spreading a rumor on the 31st of December 2019. Three teams of experts from Beijing conducted a detailed investigation from the 31st December to 4th January, 8-16 January and 18-19 January. It was revealed that the disease was a new type of epidemic, which had not been reported earlier.

      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] :\n",
      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our own analysis, it was observed that the success of China's efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance, strict regulation and spontaneous community/citizen participation. Although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage, once the disease was confirmed as a new one, collective responses at the community, ward, city, province and national levels were significant. To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .\n",
      "\n",
      "These lessons are also reflected in the WHO research roadmap [29] , where eight specific research issues have been identified with a balance of medical diagnosis and community use. It also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response, where the WHO will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences. As per [30] , governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30] .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As we started the paper with two key words \"humanitarian challenge\" and infodemic, we would like to once again highlight that basic humanitarian principles need to be followed in this type of emergency. Of course, there are geo-political, economic and social consequences, which also need to be looked at. However, humanitarian issues need to prevail over other priorities. The second point is that Coronavirus is a non-measurable disaster, unlike other invisible disasters like radioactive emission. Therefore, having correct and timely information is crucial for stopping its spread, as well as in the curative prevention of this disease. These two factors, along with good governance and citizen participation, will hold the key to success in combatting Coronavirus in future.\n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Sina Weibo's (Chinese social media) hot search list (in which a key word has been accessed every day for how many times as well as how many hours) [5] (2) Corona Virus timeline data in China (which are compiled by the authors from different data sources like Sina, Tiki-Toki, Caixin, Baidu, Tencent and provincial and municipal government data) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] (3) CSM media research data on the use of different types of media to acquire information [22, 23] ; and (4) Mob-Tech Research Institute data of use of internet during the Corona virus spread [24, 25] . Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. These data were used to understand the proliferation of certain online services compared to others, which is correlated to people's interest in different topics available online.

Authors extracted the key events from different news and social media reports. In each phase, five top public concerns are highlighted, which is prepared through word cloud analysis in each phase using the key social media data, as specified in the methodology section. As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "From our own analysis, it was observed that the success of China's efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance, strict regulation and spontaneous community/citizen participation. Although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage, once the disease was confirmed as a new one, collective responses at the community, ward, city, province and national levels were significant. To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .\n",
      "\n",
      "These lessons are also reflected in the WHO research roadmap [29] , where eight specific research issues have been identified with a balance of medical diagnosis and community use. It also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response, where the WHO will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences. As per [30] , governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30] .\n",
      "\n",
      "As we started the paper with two key words \"humanitarian challenge\" and infodemic, we would like to once again highlight that basic humanitarian principles need to be followed in this type of emergency. Of course, there are geo-political, economic and social consequences, which also need to be looked at. However, humanitarian issues need to prevail over other priorities. The second point is that Coronavirus is a non-measurable disaster, unlike other invisible disasters like radioactive emission. Therefore, having correct and timely information is crucial for stopping its spread, as well as in the curative prevention of this disease. These two factors, along with good governance and citizen participation, will hold the key to success in combatting Coronavirus in future.\n",

      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) started spreading in December 2019 and was noticed in early January 2020. It started spreading in China in mid-to late-January. Among the different types of confusion and information challenges, we need to recognize that COVID-19 is first and foremost a humanitarian challenge [1] . As of 24 March, 2020, the virus has caused the death of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people are confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 are serious. As many as 184 out of 195 countries are affected. Solving the humanitarian challenge is the key priority through proper preventive measures to stop its spread, as well as curative measure to develop a vaccine. The impact of this public health emergency has affected countries and communities in terms of economic, socio-psychological issues, as well as international relations.\n",

      "\"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the Munich Security Conference on 15 February 2020. WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched as a new information platform after WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal\n",

      "The data on Coronavirus are changing on daily basis, and it is difficult to provide current statistics for the affected, recovered and casualties. However, based on some initial studies, a few characteristics are emerging for this virus. It is reported that the case-fatality-rate (CFR) for Coronavirus was 2.3%, initially; however, the age group of 70 to 79 has an 8% CFR, and CFR is 14.6% for those more than 80 years old [3] . This means that the virus has a stronger impact on the aged population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other characteristic of the virus is its speed in spreading. When Dr. Zhong Nan Shan made a public announcement of this virus in CCTV on the 20th of January, the virus had already spread in different provinces in China, as well as outside China. Every day, some new countries are added to the list, which has already reached more than 100 countries and regions. It took only 30 days to spread from one city to the entire country of China. The early cases may have been spread from the Wuhan seafood market, while later cases were spread from person to person, the speed of which surprised the health workers in Wuhan city and Hubei province. The epidemic curve shown in [4] as well as presented later in this paper, shows that the second to the third week of January was the most crucial time, when the spread was very high.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some similarities and differences among COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: 2002-2003 (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: 2012-ongoing (MARS). SARS also had a zoonotic transmission in markets in Guangdong Province, China. It is said that COVID-19 is likely to have been transmitted from bats via palm civets. Similarly, MERS was also traced to zoonotic transmission of a novel coronavirus (likely from bats via dromedary camels) in Saudi Arabia. All three viruses have similar syndromes like fever and cough, which frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease. However, SARS has a higher CFR of 9.6%, while MARS is even higher at a rate of 34.4%. Despite much higher CFRs for SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has led to more total deaths due to the large number of cases.\n",

      "Projection shows a significant recession in the global economy due to Coronavirus spread [1] . The global surge reflects a new inflection point in this epidemic. Four 'major transmission complexes' (i.e., China, East Asia, Middle East, Europe) are now active, while the US is already at a tipping point. The analysis says that continued spread within established complexes plus community transmission in new complexes drives a~0.3%-0.7% reduction in 2020 global GDP growth. The impact on demand slows down the growth of the global economy by between 1.8%-2.2%, instead of the 2.5% growth envisioned at the start of the year. Sectors are impacted differently. Certain sectors (e.g., aviation, tourism, hospitality) see lower demand for a longer duration. For others (e.g., consumer goods), demand is initially lower but expected to rebound quickly. The report also argues that 24th of February 2020 was a turning point, when the cases outside Chine exceeded in-China cases for the first time. South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan and Singapore are the top five countries outside China which have reported a maximum number of cases, with Iran reporting the largest number of casualties outside China.\n",

      "To focus on the key word \"information\", which is crucial for any invisible disaster, a series of different types of data were analyzed. Primary data sources include:\n",

Four specific types of analysis were made based on the above-mentioned data sources:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Timeline narrative, number of affected people and public concern: The timeline narrative is developed based on the sequential events in the country, and important measures taken, which is also juxtaposed to the major public concerns. Weibo's data (2020) have been analyzed for the top 206 to 360 hits per topic (depends on the daily variation) over a period of three months, from 1 December 2019 to 1 March 2020 [24] . Tiki-Toki's data [9] is the Chinese government big data platform, and provides information on different government measures, news, policies, and also is linked to major global milestones in the related topic (here, Coronavirus-related topics). Sina's data was on (1) the number of affected people (confirmed cases, recovery, and death) at both the country level and in Hubei province, (2) Sina Weibo data to analyze social media information. Figure 1a ,b show the growth in the number of affected and recovered people and casualties in Hubei province and the whole of China, which is referred to in a later section. Figure 2 was also prepared as an original diagram to highlight different phases of this disaster. Specific attention was made on the day to day changes in numbers, any significant policy actions taken, and any significant incidence (positive or negative) reported on social media or a website. Social media/website information (both government official sites as well private sites) were used to draw the timeseries narrative. Word Cloud analysis was made using the key words used in social media for all the five phases mentioned in the text, and the top five most commonly used words are picked to highlight the key discussion in the social media, as well as to understand citizens' agony. (b) Media use during/after Coronavirus spread and information types: This is mainly derived from the analysis of [23] on February 20-21, 2020, with more than 1500 residents from all 31 provinces in China, to understand the use of media to acquire information related to Corona virus. The analysis used the data of CSM survey to draw original graphs and diagrams with its interpretation; (c) Positive impact on certain online industries: The data from [24] are based on the analysis of 2019 and 2020 analysis, but more specific intensive analysis of the use of the internet during the period of 22 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As per the available statistics, the earliest case was reported on 1 December, 2019 in Wuhan, and thereafter sporadic cases have been reported all through December, especially in the later part of the month. The first case was reported in a paper [26] on 1st of December 2019. The health commission of Wuhan municipality reported the first case of Coronavirus (at the time, an unusual disease). These were unusual cases, which took the local physicians by surprise, and it was Dr. Li Wen Liang who reported the unusual case as a possible epidemic in WeChat social media on 30th of December 2019. \n",

      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] : \n",
      "\n",
      "As seen in Figure 5 , medicine, food supply and online education were the top searched items. Online food supply users have drastically increased by 10 million, with an increase of 10.60 million in delivery capacity (by volume) when comparing the data of online food shopping of January 2019 with that of January 2020. A significant increase is observed in users with the age group 35 to 44 years, from 27.9% (January 2019) to 45.1% (January 2020). Specific increase has been noted with households with children from 0 to 3 years old (from 7.2 % of January 2019 to 25.2 % in January 2020). The available data show that four major online food supply companies have increased their delivery capacity by a significant percentage. They are as follows: Hema Fresh (up by 50% compared to before the virus spread), Miss Fresh (up by 321% compared to January 2019), Dingdong Maicai (up by 300% from December 2019), and Jing dong Daojia (up by 470% compared to January 2019). All the companies are struggling with a lack of human resources and shared their employees to help each other, which delayed delivery in several cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Online education has also seen significant changes. On 27 January 2020, the Central Government Education Ministry has declared to postpone the start of classes until after the spring vacation. There was an instant rise in online education (Xueersi online internet school) after that, which saw a drastic increase by twenty-fold from 0.52 million to 11.54 million users within a period of one week (28 January to 6 February, 2020).\n",

      "\n",
      "WHO, in a recent joint study with Chinese colleagues, has summarized four specific key lessons as follows [3] :\n",
      "\n",
      "China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. Although initially quite aggressive, gradually, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor its implementation; 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieving China's exceptional coverage with adherence to these containment measures has only been possible due to the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat. At a community level, this is reflected in the remarkable solidarity of provinces and cities in support of the most vulnerable populations and communities; 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "China's bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic; 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our own analysis, it was observed that the success of China's efforts in controlling the disease was a combination of strong governance, strict regulation and spontaneous community/citizen participation. Although it was a late response in terms of the local and provincial government at the initial stage, once the disease was confirmed as a new one, collective responses at the community, ward, city, province and national levels were significant. To keep this large a number of people confined in their homes for almost two months was not an easy decision in terms of both economic and socio-psychological aspects. China's mobile network and big data system was able to create the QR code-screening of people, which can be considered a significant achievement. As mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, WHO DG has termed this virus spread as infodemic; having the right information was key to the success of mitigation measures. At an early stage, The Supreme Court's directives on fake news were a very good step in this regard to reduce the spread of confusion and panic. The \"Rumors exposed website\" created by Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) helped to share information on fake news and rumors effectively. Whenever there was fake news published or some mismanagement happened with the emergency goods and food supplies, quick corrective measures were taken by the authorities. At the village level, local communities and volunteers worked hard to ensure the implementation of the mitigation measures to reduce the spread as well as to report confirmed or suspected cases. At an early stage, data management was an issue, but once the virus was confirmed and declared by the government, strict data management measures were put into place. In this case, strict corrective measures were ensured for the mismanagement of data. The current case needs a science based solutions with local action [28] .\n",
      "\n",
      "These lessons are also reflected in the WHO research roadmap [29] , where eight specific research issues have been identified with a balance of medical diagnosis and community use. It also emphasized social science research in the outbreak response, where the WHO will establish a team that will be integrated within multidisciplinary research and operational platforms and will connect with existing and expanded global networks of social sciences. As per [30] , governments will not be able to minimize deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the economic impact of viral spread. Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put measures in place to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have a spread of COVID-19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact [30] .\n",
      "\n",
      "As we started the paper with two key words \"humanitarian challenge\" and infodemic, we would like to once again highlight that basic humanitarian principles need to be followed in this type of emergency. Of course, there are geo-political, economic and social consequences, which also need to be looked at. However, humanitarian issues need to prevail over other priorities. The second point is that Coronavirus is a non-measurable disaster, unlike other invisible disasters like radioactive emission. Therefore, having correct and timely information is crucial for stopping its spread, as well as in the curative prevention of this disease. These two factors, along with good governance and citizen participation, will hold the key to success in combatting Coronavirus in future.\n",

The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that interacts with host cell receptor that is angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). After binding the S2 subunit forms fusion between the virus and host cell membranes [3] . However, our experiences from SARS-CoV have shown that the proteolytic action of host proteases are very important for the viral entry to the host cell. While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1-S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane [4] .

One of these proteases is Factor Xa that has been shown to facilitate to activate SARS-CoV entry into the host cells [5] .

In order to be able to analyse, analytically, the dependence of the latter parameters from the former we need an exact form for the solution of the SIR dynamics in the time domain. Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain. The form of the exact solution is then used to derive the scaling behaviour of I P , t P , t E and of the epidemic speed d ρ/ dt | P by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ.\n",

In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

The occurrence time t P of the peak and the entire time-span t E of the epidemic can be reduced by a factor 1/ λ if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. This means that, unless a drastic slow down of the epidemic is needed, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing.

      "The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

All rights reserved. factors such as the capacity of the medical infrastructure to treat a big number of infected. On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5.

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

The occurrence time t P of the peak and the entire time-span t E of the epidemic can be reduced by a factor 1/ λ if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. This means that, unless a drastic slow down of the epidemic is needed, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. In the final part of the paper we apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics.

      "The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

The policies of different countries for fighting the COVID-19 usually contemplate a mixture of the three types of measures mentioned above. Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

      "The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N . If ρ > 1 the epidemic starts with the number of infected individuals I growing exponentially, it reaches a maximum I P at a time t P , then decreases down to zero at time t E when the epidemic ends.\n",

The policies of different countries for fighting the COVID-19 usually contemplate a mixture of the three types of measures mentioned above. Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve.

In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5.

In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

The policies of different countries for fighting the COVID-19 usually contemplate a mixture of the three types of measures mentioned above. Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly. On the other hand, increasing t P means increasing the time-span in which the containment measures are effective, with potentially disruptive effects both on the economies and the live of the populations in the involved countries.\n",

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

This means that, unless a drastic slow down of the epidemic is needed, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing.

However, this is not what we are interested in. Actually, we want to know what happens to the epidemic parameters listed above when we increase the threshold γ . Let us first observe that both the number of infected at the peak I P (see Eq. (9a) and the total number of infected I E (see Eq. (11) are decreasing functions of the parameter γ .

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact. For instance most of the European countries have focused their COVID-19 fighting strategies on measures aimed at reducing the infection rate α.

      "A general feature of the epidemic dynamics is that the reduction of the epidemic peak I P can be only achieved at the expenses of increasing t P and t E , i.e of increasing the time-span of the epidemic. This is evident if one looks at the curves showing the behaviour of the number of infected I ( t ) as a function of time. Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. factors such as the capacity of the medical infrastructure to treat a big number of infected. On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly. On the other hand, increasing t P means increasing the time-span in which the containment measures are effective, with potentially disruptive effects both on the economies and the live of the populations in the involved countries.\n",

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain. The form of the exact solution is then used to derive the scaling behaviour of I P , t P , t E and of the epidemic speed d ρ/ dt | P by reducing the infection rate α and by increasing the removal rate β by a factor of λ.\n",

This means that, unless a drastic slow down of the epidemic is needed, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. In the final part of the paper we apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy.

This scaling transformation leaves invariant the epidemic threshold γ and tells us that we can increase (reduce) the timescale of the epidemic by simultaneously reducing (increasing) both α and β. However, this is not what we are interested in. Actually, we want to know what happens to the epidemic parameters listed above when we increase the threshold γ . Let us first observe that both the number of infected at the peak I P (see Eq. (9a) and the total number of infected I E (see Eq. (11) are decreasing functions of the parameter γ .

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

      "The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

This is evident if one looks at the curves showing the behaviour of the number of infected I ( t ) as a function of time. Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. factors such as the capacity of the medical infrastructure to treat a big number of infected. On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

This is evident if one looks at the curves showing the behaviour of the number of infected I ( t ) as a function of time. Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

Let us first observe that both the number of infected at the peak I P (see Eq. (9a) and the total number of infected I E (see Eq. (11) are decreasing functions of the parameter γ .

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly.

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics.

In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve. The flattening of the epidemic curve may have both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 0960-0779/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5.

The situation is of course different if and when the sanitary system is overwhelmed by the epidemic, as it happened in the first phase of the COVID-19 diffusion in many countries or regions, also as a result of its unexpectedly fast spreading.\n",

Whereas it is quite clear that social distancing reduces the parameter α and does not change β, the effect of other measures like, early detection and contacts tracing is not a priori evident. Early detection and contact tracing increase β only if implemented on a large scale and followed by prompt and strict isolation of the detected infectives. If this is not the case, it is likely that these measures just bring a small reduction of α The recent analysis of Gaeta [10] of the different strategies used in Northern Italy to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic seems to confirm this result. He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those based on social distancing.\n",
      "The recent COVID-19 epidemics is posing formidable challenges both to the health and economic systems worldwide. In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the reproduction number (also called reproduction rate) ρ, eventually below the threshold, i.e ρ < 1. In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N . If ρ > 1 the epidemic starts with the number of infected individuals I growing exponentially, it reaches a maximum I P at a time t P , then decreases down to zero at time t E when the epidemic ends.\n",

The policies of different countries for fighting the COVID-19 usually contemplate a mixture of the three types of measures mentioned above. Obviously, the choice of focusing on one kind of measure instead of another depends on a number of factors, which include not only its effectiveness but also its feasibility and its social and economic impact.

Lowering α and/or increasing β will result in flattening the curves, i.e in a reduction of the epidemic peak together with an increasing of the width of the curve.

On the one hand for epidemics like COVID-19 having a high rate of hospitalised infected with severe symptoms, reduction of I P and the slow down of the epidemic is necessary in order to allow the health systems to treat them properly. On the other hand, increasing t P means increasing the time-span in which the containment measures are effective, with potentially disruptive effects both on the economies and the live of the populations in the involved countries.\n",

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ.

It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics.

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region.

On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic dynamics.

In a simple SIR Model [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 1] , which we consider in this paper, ρ depends on the infection rate α, the removal rate β and the total population N .

Using a time reparametrization we linearize the SIR equations. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain.

The occurrence time t P of the peak and the entire time-span t E of the epidemic can be reduced by a factor 1/ λ if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. This means that, unless a drastic slow down of the epidemic is needed, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. In the final part of the paper we apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy.

However, this is not what we are interested in. Actually, we want to know what happens to the epidemic parameters listed above when we increase the threshold γ . Let us first observe that both the number of infected at the peak I P (see Eq. (9a) and the total number of infected I E (see Eq. (11) are decreasing functions of the parameter γ .

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate β by a factor λ instead of reducing the infection rate α by a factor 1/ λ allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/ λ. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with λ = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number ρ 0 > > 1. In fact the factor λ is limited by λ < ρ 0 , simply because for λ > ρ 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance ρ 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing β represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.\n",

Using an exact solution for the epidemic dynamics we have been able to derive the scaling behaviour of these quantities under change of the two parameters (the infection rate α and the removal rate β) of the SIR model, which can be controlled by the containment measures.

If by increasing β we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale. This is surely an advantage when the sanitary system can deal with the epidemic because in this way containment measures do not have to be implemented for a long time span.

Whereas it is quite clear that social distancing reduces the parameter α and does not change β, the effect of other measures like, early detection and contacts tracing is not a priori evident. Early detection and contact tracing increase β only if implemented on a large scale and followed by prompt and strict isolation of the detected infectives. If this is not the case, it is likely that these measures just bring a small reduction of α The recent analysis of Gaeta [10] of the different strategies used in Northern Italy to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic seems to confirm this result. He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those based on social distancing.\n",

Generalisations of it are necessary in order to give a good descriptions of real epidemics. For instance, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic a generalization of the SIR model seems to be necessary in order to take into account the presence of a large set of a asymptomatic infective [9] [10] [11] . On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic dynamics. For this reason we believe that, at least at qualitative level, the main result of this paper -the possibility to reduce the epidemic peak keeping under control its timescale by acting on removal rates-could remain true for generalized and improved SIR-like models.\n",
