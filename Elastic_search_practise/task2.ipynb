Meteorological variations and air pollution are likely to play a role in these infections. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the number of emergency visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and to evaluate the association between ILI/SARI, RVI prevalence, and meteorological factors/air pollution, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, from November 2008 to October 2010. METHODS: Eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three hospitalizations (adults and children) for respiratory symptoms were correlated with meteorological parameters and air pollutants. In a subset of adults, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed through IFI test. The data were analyzed using time-series analysis. RESULTS: Influenza-like illness and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (30·9%) and 2063 (17·7%) patients, respectively. Thirty-seven (9·0%) samples were positive by IFI and 93 of 410 (22·7%) were IFI and/or PCR positive. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IFI positivity was statistically associated with absolute humidity, use of air conditioning, and presence of mold in home. Sunshine duration was significantly associated with the frequency of ILI cases. For SARI cases, the variables mean temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and mean concentration of pollutants were singnificant. CONCLUSIONS: At least 22% of infections in adult patients admitted to ER with respiratory complaints were caused by RVI.

There is little information about the systemic cytokine status in viral respiratory-infected asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine changes in circulating cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5) and chemokines (MCP1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in patients with an asthmatic versus a non-asthmatic background with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or adenovirus respiratory infection. In addition, human monocyte cultures were incubated with respiratory viruses to determine the cytokine/chemokine profiles. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients with asthmatic (n = 34) and non-asthmatic (n = 18) history and respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus were studied. Healthy individuals with similar age and sex (n = 10) were used as controls. Cytokine/chemokine content in blood and culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. Monocytes were isolated by Hystopaque gradient and cocultured with each of the above-mentioned viruses. RESULTS: Similar increased cytokine concentrations were observed in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. However, higher concentrations of chemokines were observed in asthmatic patients. Virus-infected monocyte cultures showed similar cytokine/chemokine profiles to those observed in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating cytokine profiles induced by acute viral lung infection were not related to asthmatic status, except for chemokines that were already increased in the asthmatic status. Monocytes could play an important role in the increased circulating concentration of cytokines found during respiratory viral infections.',\n",

       "     'abstract': 'During the intracellular life of Salmonella enterica, a unique membrane-bound compartment termed Salmonella-containing vacuole, or SCV, is formed. By means of translocated effector proteins, intracellular Salmonella also induce the formation of extensive, highly dynamic membrane tubules termed Salmonella-induced filaments or SIF. Here we report the first detailed ultrastructural analyses of the SCV and SIF by electron microscopy (EM), EM tomography and live cell correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We found that a subset of SIF is composed of double membranes that enclose portions of host cell cytosol and cytoskeletal filaments within its inner lumen. Despite some morphological similarities, we found that the formation of SIF double membranes is independent from autophagy and requires the function of the effector proteins SseF and SseG.

By means of translocated effector proteins, intracellular Salmonella also induce the formation of extensive, highly dynamic membrane tubules termed Salmonella-induced filaments or SIF. Here we report the first detailed ultrastructural analyses of the SCV and SIF by electron microscopy (EM), EM tomography and live cell correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We found that a subset of SIF is composed of double membranes that enclose portions of host cell cytosol and cytoskeletal filaments within its inner lumen. Despite some morphological similarities, we found that the formation of SIF double membranes is independent from autophagy and requires the function of the effector proteins SseF and SseG. The lumen of SIF network is accessible to various types of endocytosed material and our CLEM analysis of double membrane SIF demonstrated that fluid phase markers accumulate only between the inner and outer membrane of these structures, a space continual with endosomal lumen.

To facilitate biological, biochemical and molecular research on the medicinal chemicals in I. indigotica, here we report the first I. indigotica transcriptome generated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RESULTS: RNA-seq library was created using RNA extracted from a mixed sample including leaf and root. A total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads. The quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes. Based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study, and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. According to Gene Ontology classification, 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Swiss-Port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes, respectively. Analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular study of I. indigotica.

       "     'abstract': 'Translational readthrough—suppression of termination at a stop codon—is exploited in the replication cycles of several viruses and represents a potential target for antiviral intervention. In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an ∼8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus. These high levels of readthrough were achieved using a two-plasmid system, with Gag and Gag-Pol expressed from separate infectious clones. We also modulated readthrough by silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) or by introducing aminoglycosides into the cells. The data obtained indicate that gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis but are very sensitive to a reduction in levels of this polyprotein. Thus, as is also the case for ribosomal frameshifting, antiviral therapies targeting readthrough with inhibitory agents are likely to be the most beneficial. IMPORTANCE Many pathogenic RNA viruses and retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough to regulate expression of their replicase enzymes. These translational “recoding” processes are potential targets for antiviral intervention, but we have only a limited understanding of the consequences to virus replication of modulating the efficiency of recoding, particularly for those viruses employing readthrough. In this paper, we describe the first systematic analysis of the effect of increasing or decreasing readthrough efficiency on virus replication using the gammaretrovirus MuLV as a model system. We find unexpectedly that MuLV replication is only slightly inhibited by substantial increases in readthrough frequency, but as with other viruses that use recoding strategies, replication is quite sensitive to even modest reductions. These studies provide insights into both the readthrough process and MuLV replication and have implications for the selection of antivirals against gammaretroviruses.',\n",

In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an ∼8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus.

The SOFA score showed the greatest difference between surviving and non-surviving groups (P = .003) with similar results in ARDS patients (P = .005). sRAGE levels tended to be higher in non-surviving (P = .058) and ARDS patients (P = .058). Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that SOFA (P = .013) and sRAGE (P = .05) were the only variables that modified the probability of a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: The association of elevated sRAGE with a fatal outcome suggests that it may have an independent causal effect in CAP. SOFA scores were the only clinical factor with the ability to identify surviving and ARDS patients.\",2012-01-20,\"Narvaez-Rivera, Rodrigo M; Rendon, Adrian; Salinas-Carmona, Mario C; Rosas-Taraco, Adrian G\",BMC Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/05bbb228a1d50e89500669fec042d288d0796c6b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3274434.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274434/,\\r'}}, {'_index': 'metafile', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'UjhW93MBdq74P7QnRv-0', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'@timestamp': '2020-08-16T12:54:37.674Z', 'path': '/home/phani/Downloads/Data/551982_1387024_bundle_archive/metadata.csv', 'license': 'cc-by', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'title': 'Virus Identification in Unknown Tropical Febrile Illness Cases Using Deep Sequencing', 'who_covidence_id': None, 'sha': '9692bb55e1e2eec083333ee2139137e6ddf3a4d8', 'cord_uid': '6gow0x1v', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274504/', 'source_x': 'PMC', 'pmc_json_files': 'document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3274504.xml.json', 'pdf_json_files': 'document_parses/pdf_json/9692bb55e1e2eec083333ee2139137e6ddf3a4d8.json', 'abstract': 'Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50–100 million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an etiologic pathogen in ∼40% of dengue-like illnesses.

Our work reveals how manipulation of the endosomal membrane system by an intracellular pathogen results in a unique tubular membrane compartmentalization of the host cell, generating a shielded niche permissive for intracellular proliferation of Salmonella.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-09-25\", \"authors\"=>\"Krieger, Viktoria; Liebl, David; Zhang, Yuying; Rajashekar, Roopa; Chlanda, Petr; Giesker, Katrin; Chikkaballi, Deepak; Hensel, Michael\", \"journal\"=>\"PLoS Pathog\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177991/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'PLoS Pathog', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177991/', 'sha': '590dc551804c7579ac9623ee64f81d1186261faa', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': 'tk4dmey5'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'jYmT_XMB0hkguZkjYfo7', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.1371/journal.pone.0102963', 'title': 'High-Throughput Sequencing and De Novo Assembly of the Isatis indigotica Transcriptome', 'publish_time': '2014-09-26', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Tang, Xiaoqing; Xiao, Yunhua; Lv, Tingting; Wang, Fangquan; Zhu, QianHao; Zheng, Tianqing; Yang, Jie', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4178013', 'pubmed_id': 25259890, 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Isatis indigotica, the source of the traditional Chinese medicine Radix isatidis (Ban-Lan-Gen), is an extremely important economical crop in China.

Deciding on the number, geographic location and hospitals to be selected as sentinel sites was a challenge. Based on the recently published WHO guideline for influenza surveillance (2012), this study presents the process for hospital sentinel site selection. METHODS: From the 2,165 hospitals in Indonesia, the first step was to shortlist to hospitals that had previously participated in respiratory disease surveillance systems and had acceptable surveillance performance history.

Deciding on the number, geographic location and hospitals to be selected as sentinel sites was a challenge. Based on the recently published WHO guideline for influenza surveillance (2012), this study presents the process for hospital sentinel site selection. METHODS: From the 2,165 hospitals in Indonesia, the first step was to shortlist to hospitals that had previously participated in respiratory disease surveillance systems and had acceptable surveillance performance history. The second step involved categorizing the shortlist according to five regions in Indonesia to maximize geographic representativeness. A checklist was developed based on the WHO recommended attributes for sentinel site selection including stability, feasibility, representativeness and the availability of data to enable disease burden estimation. Eight hospitals, a maximum of two per geographic region, were visited for checklist administration.

In conclusion, we identified a 5.9 kDa C-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen α chain as an early serum biomarker of fibrogenic processes in patients with liver disease.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-10-02\", \"authors\"=>\"Marfà, Santiago; Crespo, Gonzalo; Reichenbach, Vedrana; Forns, Xavier; Casals, Gregori; Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Navasa, Miquel; Jiménez, Wladimiro\", \"journal\"=>\"PLoS One\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183580/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'PLoS One', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183580/', 'sha': '1542e8e707bd5fa1cb6b3919722fc30ced018c1f', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': '6t5puo6p'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'e4mT_XMB0hkguZkjX_qn', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.4161/mabs.24291', 'title': 'Removal of a C-terminal serine residue proximal to the inter-chain disulfide bond of a human IgG1 lambda light chain mediates enhanced antibody stability and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity', 'publish_time': '2013-05-01', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Shen, Yang; Zeng, Lin; Zhu, Aiping; Blanc, Tim; Patel, Dipa; Pennello, Anthony; Bari, Amtul; Ng, Stanley; Persaud, Kris; Kang, Yun (Kenneth); Balderes, Paul; Surguladze, David; Hindi, Sagit; Zhou, Qinwei; Ludwig, Dale L.; Snavely, Marshall', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4169035', 'pubmed_id': 23567210, 'abstract': 'Optimization of biophysical properties is a critical success factor for the developability of monoclonal antibodies with potential therapeutic applications.

Collectively, these results show that the emerging MERS-CoV is a target of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins and demonstrate that mechanisms other than accumulation of endosomal cholesterol can contribute to viral entry inhibition by IFITMs.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-09-26\", \"authors\"=>\"Wrensch, Florian; Winkler, Michael; Pöhlmann, Stefan\", \"journal\"=>\"Viruses\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189045/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'Viruses', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189045/', 'sha': '2fd379bd7d8ce15f444b2fa608e6c5899441d52a', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': 'pg466dan'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 's4mT_XMB0hkguZkjYfo7', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.4161/viru.29652', 'title': 'Effector biology during biotrophic invasion of plant cells', 'publish_time': '2014-10-01', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Chaudhari, Prateek; Ahmed, Bulbul; Joly, David L; Germain, Hugo', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4189876', 'pubmed_id': 25513771, 'abstract': 'Several obligate biotrophic phytopathogens, namely oomycetes and fungi, invade and feed on living plant cells through specialized structures known as haustoria.

This review provides insight on the development of intranasal DNA vaccine for respiratory infections, with special attention paid to the strategies to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines using non-viral delivery agents.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-07-10\", \"authors\"=>\"Xu, Yingying; Yuen, Pak-Wai; Lam, Jenny Ka-Wing\", \"journal\"=>\"Pharmaceutics\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190526/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'Pharmaceutics', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190526/', 'sha': 'aa14d6de32495ec579e30a5c6f1ae21666c01c8a', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': '0bma2749'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'g4mT_XMB0hkguZkjX_qo', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.1186/s12917-014-0215-6', 'title': 'Management of the slowly emerging zoonosis, Hendra virus, by private veterinarians in Queensland, Australia: a qualitative study', 'publish_time': '2014-09-17', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Mendez, Diana H; Kelly, Jenny; Buttner, Petra; Nowak, Madeleine; Speare, Rick', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4173005', 'pubmed_id': 25224910, 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Veterinary infection control for the management of Hendra virus (HeV), an emerging zoonosis in Australia, remained suboptimal until 2010 despite 71.4% (5/7) of humans infected with HeV being veterinary personnel or assisting a veterinarian, three of whom died before 2009.

In pathology, present study mainly focused on the immune mechanism, but very few studies have concerned with the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH. To study the antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative against DVH, we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using the sodium trimetaphosphate–sodium tripolyphosphate method. Ducklings were drunk with icariin and p-icariin after being challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1 (DHV-1). We recorded the number of dead ducklings, gross pathological changes in the liver, and changes in indices of oxidative stress and liver injury. The correlations between these indices were also analyzed. RESULTS: Exposure to DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings. Administration of icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and significantly increased the survival rate, with better outcomes in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated with icariin. Icariin and p-icariin also attenuated the changes in oxidative stress and liver injury. We found positive correlations among indices of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and liver injury (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase), suggesting that DHV-1 causes significant oxidative damage, which is related to the extent of hepatic injury.

In pathology, present study mainly focused on the immune mechanism, but very few studies have concerned with the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH.

Using Xenopus laevis egg extract, we found that increases in cytosolic calcium lead to the activation of an endogenous ribonuclease, XendoU. A fraction of XendoU localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is required for nuclear envelope assembly and ER network formation in a catalysis-dependent manner.

These findings clearly show that the neuraminidase helps SIV move through the mucus, which is important for the virus to reach and infect epithelial cells and eventually become shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-10-15\", \"authors\"=>\"Yang, Xiaoyun; Steukers, Lennert; Forier, Katrien; Xiong, Ranhua; Braeckmans, Kevin; Van Reeth, Kristien; Nauwynck, Hans\", \"journal\"=>\"PLoS One\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4198190/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'PLoS One', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4198190/', 'sha': '6eb145a990b1132457f78c4e1521ab827b715ad0', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': '779czzzx'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'yImT_XMB0hkguZkjYfo7', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.1292/jvms.14-0098', 'title': 'US-Like Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Outbreaks in Taiwan, 2013–2014', 'publish_time': '2014-06-05', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'LIN, Chao-Nan; CHUNG, Wen-Bin; CHANG, Shu-Wei; WEN, Chi-Chi; LIU, Hung; CHIEN, Chi-Hsien; CHIOU, Ming-Tang', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4197162', 'pubmed_id': 24898162, 'abstract': 'Since late 2013, several outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have emerged in Taiwan.

PROCEDURES: Proteins expressed in the islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. RESULTS: Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets, most of which have not been previously linked to type 1 diabetes. Five protein-protein interacting clusters were identified, and the cellular localization of selected proteins was validated immunohistochemically. Migratory activity-related proteins, including plastin-2 (LCP1), moesin (MSN), lamin-B1 (LMNB1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) and others, were identified in CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages infiltrated to inflamed FT1DM islets.

AM provides a framework for using multiple models to facilitate public-health decision making and an objective basis for updating management actions in response to improved scientific understanding.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-10-21\", \"authors\"=>\"Shea, Katriona; Tildesley, Michael J.; Runge, Michael C.; Fonnesbeck, Christopher J.; Ferrari, Matthew J.\", \"journal\"=>\"PLoS Biol\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204804/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'PLoS Biol', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204804/', 'sha': 'c4bddec0b339a9f5ea397a7390327d12c72159a2', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': '8olbj1l8'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '04mT_XMB0hkguZkjYfo7', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.1371/journal.pone.0110647', 'title': 'Proteome Profile of Swine Testicular Cells Infected with Porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus', 'publish_time': '2014-10-21', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Ma, Ruili; Zhang, Yanming; Liu, Haiquan; Ning, Pengbo', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4204940', 'pubmed_id': 25333634, 'abstract': 'The interactions occurring between a virus and a host cell during a viral infection are complex.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/H3N2 strains clustered each year to a distinct group while most A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the S203T clade. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In Cambodia, from 2009 to 2011, influenza activity occurred throughout the year with peak seasonality during the rainy season from June to November. Seasonal influenza epidemics were due to multiple genetically distinct viruses, even though all of the isolates were antigenically similar to the reference vaccine strains. The drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains revealed that neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective.\", \"publish_time\"=>\"2014-10-23\", \"authors\"=>\"Horm, Srey Viseth; Mardy, Sek; Rith, Sareth; Ly, Sovann; Heng, Seng; Vong, Sirenda; Kitsutani, Paul; Ieng, Vannra; Tarantola, Arnaud; Ly, Sowath; Sar, Borann; Chea, Nora; Sokhal, Buth; Barr, Ian; Kelso, Anne; Horwood, Paul F.; Timmermans, Ans; Hurt, Aeron; Lon, Chanthap; Saunders, David; Ung, Sam An; Asgari, Nima; Roces, Maria Concepcion; Touch, Sok; Komadina, Naomi; Buchy, Philippe\", \"journal\"=>\"PLoS One\", \"Microsoft Academic Paper ID\"=>\"\", \"WHO #Covidence\"=>\"\", \"has_pdf_parse\"=>\"True\", \"has_pmc_xml_parse\"=>\"True\", \"full_text_file\"=>\"comm_use_subset\", \"url\"=>\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207757/\"}', 'host': 'phani-HP-Pavilion-x360-Convertible-14m-ba0xx', 'journal': 'PLoS One', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207757/', 'sha': 'bb6be6d67dbc92ee528f4c09ca1643eeda4316bd', 'full_text_file': 'comm_use_subset', 'cord_uid': 'tvv4ub59'}}, {'_index': 'mongo11', '_type': '_doc', '_id': '3omT_XMB0hkguZkjYfo7', '_score': 0.578131, '_source': {'doi': '10.1371/journal.pone.0110911', 'title': 'Integrin β3 Is Required in Infection and Proliferation of Classical Swine Fever Virus', 'publish_time': '2014-10-23', 'logdate': '2020-08-17T17:52:52+00:00', 'authors': 'Li, Weiwei; Wang, Gang; Liang, Wulong; Kang, Kai; Guo, Kangkang; Zhang, Yanming', 'WHO #Covidence': '', 'pmcid': 'PMC4207786', 'pubmed_id': 25340775, 'abstract': 'Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly infectious fatal pig disease, resulting in huge economic loss to the swine industry.

Through studies of their impact on human biology and clinical phenotype, the contributions of these variants to the pathogenesis, progression, and/or treatment outcome of many diseases that involve immunoglobulin have become evident. They affect susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens, constitute as risk factors for IgG or IgE mediated inflammatory diseases, and impact the development of many autoimmune conditions.

METHODS: We searched publicly accessible Internet data on the H7N9 outbreak primarily from government and major mass media websites in China up to February 10, 2014. Two researchers independently extracted, compared, and confirmed the information of each confirmed H7N9 case using a self-designed data extraction form. We summarized the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases and compared them with those from the field study. RESULTS: According to our data updated until February 10, 2014, 334 confirmed H7N9 cases were identified. The median age was 58 years and 67.0% (219/327) were males. Cases were reported in 15 regions in China. Five family clusters were found. Of the 16.8% (56/334) of the cases with relevant data, 69.6% (39/56) reported a history of exposure to animals. Of the 1751 persons with a close contact with a confirmed case, 0.6% (11/1751) of them developed respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period.

We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever >38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86% and 41.89% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m(6)A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2. CONCLUSION: We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan.

       "     'abstract': 'COVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide(1,2). As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak(7,8). Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients’ smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [‘smoking’ OR ‘tobacco’ OR ‘risk factors’ OR ‘smoker*’] AND [‘COVID-19’ OR ‘COVID 19’ OR ‘novel coronavirus’ OR ‘sars cov-2’ OR ‘sars cov 2’] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). Specifically, Zhou et al.(9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al.(10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65–7.63; p=0.2). Huang et al.(11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.(12) from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al.(13) found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58–25.00; p= 0.018). We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases(12). However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98–2.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43–4.04). In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.',\n",

To determine the probability of particular public health events, the risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration.

RESULTS: A total of 8 risk assessments were performed on 8 separate occasions between January 8(th) to February 28(th), 2020, depending on the detection and report of COVID-19 cases in other countries.

       "     'abstract': 'IMPORTANCE: Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale–Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.',\n",
